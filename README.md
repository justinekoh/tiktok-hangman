# TikTok Youth Camp Hangman Application
## Description of project
This is a single-player hangman game, written in HTML and vanilla JavaScript. It is styled using CSS. The project size is about 300 LOC.
Some planned improvements to the project include adding audio feedback to players, a scoring system and categorizing available words for players to choose from.

We chose to use vanilla JavaScript as it was sufficient to achieve our features. However, given more time we would have explored using React to implement some of the more advanced features as stated above to ease the developmental process. 

Some challenges that we faced were the lack of experience and expertise in the group. We had to refer to multiple sources online in addition to the available workshops to get started. The short amount of time available also severely limited the scale and number of features that we could add.

## How to play
Each time the player starts the game, a word is randomly selected from a list of available words. Players have to guess the letters present in the word correctly before the hangman is completed to win. For every wrong guess, a body part of the hangman is drawn. There are a total of 6 body parts(hence 6 chances).

## How to run the project
